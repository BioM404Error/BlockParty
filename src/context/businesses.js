Scottish Bagpipes can reach deep into your soul when the instrument is tuned perfectly and the performer has clean fingering and good rhythm. Anything less can cause this finicky instrument to issue a terrible noise. So if you are seeking music for a wedding, funeral, or other special ceremony, please listen carefully to each player's demos, consider where each of your bidders live, and if you get unequal price quotes, please ask yourself what might account for the differences. Generally people hire me for putting soulful expression into slow music, giving fun variety concerts, and knowing lots of peppy Irish and Scots-Canadian songs. I also lead one of the Bay Area's busiest Celtic bands.
